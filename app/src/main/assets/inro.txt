Rapid advancements in wireless communications and the wide distribution of smartphones have diversiﬁed how everyday users communicate with each other from voice-based phone calls to text messaging services and even video conferencing.
Unlike the short messaging services (SMS) over cellular networks, with smartphones, using wireless data networks and a variety of text messaging applications, users can freely exchange text (and image) messages with no additional cost beyond their data plans.
Such ﬁnacial factors combined with the changes in cultral aspects have catalized the usage of smartphone text messaging services, and a recent report on the smartphone usage patterns of U.S. users show that text messaging is now the most widely used smartphone feature, exceeding the use of Internet access and voice/video calls [1].
However, when analyzing the functionalities of many messaging applications, the features that they provide are no more advanced than the SMS features of low-end feature phones.
Speciﬁcally, these services are mostly based on a texting screen and users can selectively share images or multimedia ﬁles on their phones.
In a sense, while these applications use the wireless network to exchange text message data, they still lack the capability of connecting the users with the large amount of data available on the Internet as they exchange messages with their peers.
The powerful hardware resources of the smartphone allows for a user to not only “use” the wireless networking features (as a communication medium), but can also allow a number of interactive services to be implemented with the texting environment.
As an example, based on the text message inputs of the users, a service can potentially provide image suggestions to provide the user with a chance to better express his or her feelings to peers and deliver more visible information.
