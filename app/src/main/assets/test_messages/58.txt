Do you use correlation of the two pairs in your strategy?
No, I did not use correlation in this EA. But I am designing one robot that takes advantage of the correlations between some pairs.
How do you detect a trend? What indicators do you use?
There are many reversal indicators that can be used in this kind of strategy. I use RSI as the only indicator a when open the first position.
