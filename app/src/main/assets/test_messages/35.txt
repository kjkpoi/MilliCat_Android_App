No wayzzzz!!!
I know. It could be 10-0 before final whistle
They clearly have no spirit left
Looks like their back has been broken..
Indeed. all things considered Germany should exercise their own mercy rule
Lest the national humiliation becomes such that Brazilians tune out and begin rioting in the streets.
Whattt?!!!
Disaster of note!!!
Already 4-0. This is getting dangerous.
This is a joke!
