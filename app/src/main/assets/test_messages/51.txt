How odd. Some lady just asked me if the table i was seated at was taken. Isnt it obvious that i am siting there??
Maybe referring to the other empty chairs beside you
There r no chairs. This is one of those table with its benches attached. A picnic tsble is what its called i think
That's indeed strange. So you should give her a strange answer and that they are taken.
i said they were taken n she left
Yes just tell her the obvious
I think she was a teacher i wasnt familiar with n that she wanted to use the table to teach a student with her. Saw her with a bunch of students later so it is just as well that i said the table was taken or her n her student talking would have made it impossible fpr me to concentrate
