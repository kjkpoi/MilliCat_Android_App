Whatsapp has finally received iPhone 6 support. The keyboard no longer takes up half of the screen
Glad to be alble to use it again
What are you on? Windows Phone?
Good to hear that, but on Windows Phone it still drains my battery in half a day
The same thing happens on both my Lumia 930 and Lumia 1520
